# Knowledge Base Inference
This project contains Pytorch and Keras(theano) implementation of Knowledge Base Inference (KBI) Models used in the following publications [1][2]. The code has been developed at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT Delhi). The KBI model in this repository traines over structured knowledge bases like FB15k, WN18, NYT-FB and Yago3-10. You can also add your own KB seamlessly.
